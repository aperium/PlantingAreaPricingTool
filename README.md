## Planned Improvements

- [x] accept more flexible freestyle input units including `feet` & `'`.
- [x] require account number to reveal customer-specific pricing.
- [ ] Allow users to use custom planting densities for each product type
- [ ] Help users with beds of different shapes.
  - [x] either a help box with formulas for the areas of different shapes or a selector for users to choose the shape of bed they have.
  - [ ] Would still be nice to have a tool help.
  - [ ] Shapes of beds to include:
    - [ ] rectangle
    - [ ] triangle
    - [ ] circle
    - [ ] (maybe also oval and half circle?)
  - [ ] Add `plant spacing` as a column/option alongside `plant density`.
